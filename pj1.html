    <h3>=====Why do i like these books?=====</h3>

    <p>These books are one of my favorite books because of the imaginations they have and the
      amplification of details on each characters as well as the creativity of adding magic and beasts, the dark theme and the
      history, makes it amazing. The magic and the characters transport you to their world and learn about them.
      the concept of magic, something that is not approved by scientists makes it more interesting to know or at least
      feel like a wizard or witch.</p>
